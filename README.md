As data reporters, we can find that our skills are in demand across the newsroom, making it essential that we are able to collaborate effectively with more traditional beat reporters. We may find ourselves working with a non-data reporter who needs to be able to explore a large dataset herself, securely and on deadline. This workshop will present a selection of Python-based methods for producing exploratory visualizations at speed from medium- to large-sized and geographic datasets.

We will use web-based tools such as Colaboratory and Vega Editor, and no coding experience is required (though Google and GitHub accounts are required to be able to follow the tutorial).
